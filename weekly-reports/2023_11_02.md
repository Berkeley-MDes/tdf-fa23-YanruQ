# PROJECT3 MINI_ME_TDF_Project Reports Bot #

**OVERVIEW**  
I've already finished the basic structure and uploaded all class-related material to this MINI_ME. There're 5 instructions in intelligence wich are deliberately: welcome message, defining my name, introduction about me, projects overview from syllabus as well as projects process.

### TRAINING PROCESS ###
After feeding my bot with all the porjects I've done so far in TDF class, I strated to test out the outcome by asking simple questions about my projects ⬇️

The response I got is pretty redudent (though with all details) which I then decided to give a word limitation to the response it generated and This command will give this bot one more characteristic that resembles me: be a quite bot. My first try is 500 words.

The text length is still not readable to me, so I keep reducing it to 200, and even go for shorter response around 100 words. ⬇️

Finally, the response is short enough to appear on the same page with the questions. ⬆️
