# PROJECT3 MINI_ME_TDF_Project Reports Bot #

**OVERVIEW**  
I've already finished the basic structure and uploaded all class-related material to this MINI_ME. There're 5 instructions in intelligence which are respectively: welcome message, defining my name, introduction about me, projects overview from syllabus as well as projects process. This trained conversational bot functions as an intelligent presentation of me, assisting me report my learning experience in this course. 

### TRAINING PROCESS ###
After feeding my bot with all the porjects I've done so far in TDF class, I strated to test out the outcome by asking simple questions about my projects. Following screenshots show how I modified these setting step by step. ‚¨áÔ∏è

The response I got is pretty redudent (though with all details) which I then decided to give a word limitation to the response it generated and This command will give this bot one more characteristic that resembles me: be a quite bot. My first try is 500 words.

The text length is still not readable to me, so I keep reducing it to 200, and even go for shorter response around 100 words. ‚¨áÔ∏è

Finally, the response is short enough to appear on the same page with the questions. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è  
I then noticed that in the setting, we could adjust the maximum token for the response. I also turn up the temperature, but the result I got is a pages of mojibakeüòÖ

After turning down the temperature, it could get more accurate response to the question. ‚¨áÔ∏è

**CONCEPT FOR FINAL VIDEO**   
Since this self-reporting bot can speak for me, I planed to import all my answers to the required deliverables for this project into it and display the process of me inquiring all these information through this platform.  

**REFLECTION & LIMITATION:** Even though we can customize and expand its database, we can barely prevent it from generating incorrect information by piecing together tokens from different parts of the information chunk we provided. This is because it's still based on the ChatGPT language model. The most significant takeaway from this exercise is to consider the customizable feature of AI tools. The performance of this feedback system relies on the clarity of prompt writing. While I am modifying the settings, I always have an anticipated question that users may ask, but it can't be perfectly accurate because language is tricky. Everyone organizes words differently. That's why we need rounds of testing with different users and constant revision of the instructions based on feedback, which reminds me of another concept (cybernetics) we learned in the DND course called the networks of feedback loops.
