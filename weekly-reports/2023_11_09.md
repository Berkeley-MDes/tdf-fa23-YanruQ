### No.1 Erroed Space ###  
Parametric modeling holds significant potential for the future of theater practice, particularly in designing dynamic, innovative spaces that can adapt to the specific needs of each performance. The use of parametric tools allows for the exploration of 'errored spaces'—environments that intentionally incorporate elements of unpredictability and non-linearity, challenging traditional theater norms.   
**Technologies may include in this project:** parametric modeling; AI-generated model variations....

### No.2 Digital Imgination ###   
By harnessing the power of advanced imaging technologies and AI, the project seeks to transform static images and dynamic videos on pet's social media into an digitized representation of them. The aim of creating these digital twin is not simply capture the cat’s physical likeness but also its personality and image portrits by the account runner which questioned the fissure between digitized avatar and true identity.   
**Technologies may involve:** Digital modeling; the application of LLC in interactive media art....

**Reflection & Speculation** 
As technology becomes more seamless and integrated into our lives, there's a risk that we may prioritize these digital interactions over physical ones. This tendency prompts me to be mindful and deliberate in how we integrate the digital with the physical, preserving the essence of our tangible interactions with the world around us. Hence, for the above concepts for final projects not only function as a showcase of the technologies's power but also in some way are questioning the restriction we shall implied to technologies.
