# PROJECT4 WEEK2-'I DONT ANSWER QUESTIONS' #

### No.1 Erroed Space ###  
Parametric modeling holds significant potential for the future of theater practice, particularly in designing dynamic, innovative spaces that can adapt to the specific needs of each performance. The use of parametric tools allows for the exploration of 'errored spaces'â€”environments that intentionally incorporate elements of unpredictability and non-linearity, challenging traditional theater norms.   
**Technologies may include in this project:** parametric modeling; AI-generated model variations....
