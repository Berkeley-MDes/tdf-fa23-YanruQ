## PRESENTATION + FINALIZING CODE##
### Presentation idea
Before getting into the functional codng connection between cloud and local python code, I tried to plan the presentation format for shaowcase. Considering hidden the circuit part, I made a box that fits with the size of the button but I realized it will still have a long connecting line. Instaed, I came up with the plan that have a drop background poster laser cutted using cardboard with a basment where the big button will be placed. In order to implement this new plan, I need to know the dimension of our exhibiting slot and also get enough caardboard ready for laser cut ASAP. I will be working on the aesthics for the final presentation in the next few days.

### Serial Port/Cloud Connection
The easiest way of making connection between the binary input and the calling api function is to using serial port and keep every information locally. I am still working on the code, but after it works, I will definitely want to try sending the information to the cloud and then get it down locally.
