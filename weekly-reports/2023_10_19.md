# PHYSICAL COMPUTING - WEEK 5 #

**PROJECT NAME:** Loud Rabbit  
**GROUP MEMBERS:** Yoojin Leem, Stephanie He, **Yanru Qian**  
**OVERVIEW:** This system includes a moving character with two distinct modes. In its "SHY" mode, the character moves away from people. As people approaching in its "FRIENDLY" mode, it get closer to the subject.  
**CHALLENGES:** 
1)Changing spinning directions based on distance 2) Figuring out the condition logic behind this switching while writing the code 3)Choosing the proper sensor for desired effect 4) Photon Communication 5) Soldering when needed 6)Being flexible and able to change plans based on time...
(basically every steps we've gone through üòÖ we're learning from zero)

### PROCEDURE 1 ###
‚¨áÔ∏è Sucessfully operating two servo motors at the same time. ‚¨áÔ∏è Following the simple servo motors test from last week, I went deeper into motor movement and how to control the direction of spinning. Even though we ended up deciding not to use servo motors, I learned a lot about the machanism of motors and how it recieves signal which then applied the knowledge to the later exploration with DC motors.

### PROCEDURE 2 ###
‚¨áÔ∏è Activating **ultrasonic sensor** for incoporating distances between the subject and the object into this interactive process. ‚¨áÔ∏è  
Before choosing the ultrasonic sensor, we also tested a PIR sensor. We decided to settle on the ultrasonic sensor because it provides accurate distance information (even though it's from a linear direction). We can manipulate the movement based on the measured distance rather than a simple 1/0 signal.

### PROCEDURE 3 ###
‚¨áÔ∏è Setting up the structure for the moving object ‚¨áÔ∏è  
We switched from servo motors to DC motors because the power of servo motor is not strong enough to support the wheel movement.

To change the spinning direction, we need motor driver. Jeff offered us an [DC motor FeatherWing Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2927), and taught us how to soldering. It took us half a day to enable the moving functions, connecting extra power source to drive the motor running. We could also change the speed but we found out that there's an unpleasing sound generated when the speed are really slow.

### PROCEDURE 4 ###
‚¨áÔ∏è Code for the moving objects ‚¨áÔ∏è  
Essentially, we combined the codes from the previous exercise with this one. It took me a long time to understand the function of [interrupts](https://docs.particle.io/reference/device-os/api/interrupts/interrupts/ ) (I included the link for my own reference), but basically, the device won't send messages multiple times when it's within the range set for the "window." In Thursday's session, we also worked on the communication between two photons. After creating a shared project between two accounts, photons were able to print messages in the monitor. This part of the code is only used to activate different moving modes for the objects. The settings will change based on the input given by the other photon. Enabling cloud communication is definitely a tricky part; we need to clearly figure out what kinds of information need to be transported in between.
```Ruby
int setting;
#include "Adafruit_PWMServoDriver.h"
#include "Adafruit-MotorShield-V2.h"
#define TRIG D2
#define ECHO D4
Adafruit_MotorShield AFMS = Adafruit_MotorShield();
Adafruit_DCMotor *myMotor = AFMS.getMotor(1);
Adafruit_DCMotor *myMotor2 = AFMS.getMotor(4);
void setup() {
    pinMode(D7, OUTPUT);
    Particle.subscribe("toggle-led", friendly);  // Change MY_DEVICES as needed
    Particle.subscribe("other-led", shy);  // Change MY_DEVICES as needed
    //og code
    Serial.begin(9600);
    pinMode(TRIG, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(ECHO, INPUT);
    AFMS.begin();
    myMotor->setSpeed(255);
    myMotor2->setSpeed(255);
    myMotor->run(FORWARD);
    myMotor2->run(FORWARD);
}
void loop() {
    Particle.publish("hi", "i am alive!", PRIVATE);
    if(setting == 0) {
        //friendly code
        Particle.publish("hi", "friendly", PRIVATE);
        long duration, distance;
        digitalWrite(TRIG, LOW);
        delayMicroseconds(2);
        digitalWrite(TRIG, HIGH);
        delayMicroseconds(10);
        digitalWrite(TRIG, LOW);
        duration = pulseIn(ECHO, HIGH);
        distance = (duration / 2) * 0.0344;
        // Print the distance to the Serial Monitor
        Serial.print("Distance: ");
        Serial.print(distance);
        Serial.println(" CM");
        // Stop motors if the distance is less than 10cm
        if (distance < 10) {
            myMotor->run(RELEASE);
            myMotor2->run(RELEASE);
        } else {
            myMotor->run(FORWARD);
            myMotor2->run(FORWARD);
        }
        delay(500);
        }
    else if (setting == 1) {
        //shy code
        Particle.publish("hi", "shy", PRIVATE);
        long duration, distance;
        digitalWrite(TRIG, LOW);
        delayMicroseconds(2);
        digitalWrite(TRIG, HIGH);
        delayMicroseconds(10);
        digitalWrite(TRIG, LOW);
        duration = pulseIn(ECHO, HIGH);
        distance = (duration / 2) * 0.0344;
        // Print the distance to the Serial Monitor
        Serial.print("Distance: ");
        Serial.print(distance);
        Serial.println(" CM");
        // Stop motors if the distance is more than 10cm
        if (distance > 10) {
            myMotor->run(RELEASE);
            myMotor2->run(RELEASE);
        } else {
            myMotor->run(BACKWARD);
            myMotor2->run(BACKWARD);
        }
        delay(500);
        }
}
```
### REFLECTION & SPECULATION ###
The progress we've made so far doesn't reflect the amount of time and effort we've put into this project. It's been full of struggles and testing. I hope all these failures and frustrations we've experienced can be considered when our performance is being evaluated.  

At times, we got stuck on very simple steps, but we couldn't figure them out on our own because we haven't had enough time to understand the basics of these electronic components. We had to learn their functions while doing this project, leading to mistakes in choosing sensors and spending time on research and code testing. Even though we came up with a very ambitious plan at first, we compromised the time dedicated to decorative parts to focus on studying the actual interaction between inputs and outputs.  

In general, it could be better if we had more time to work on this project. The simple distance sensing system we simulated has a broad range of use scenarios. The most common case is radar parking sensors, which can be categorized as a solution for security and safety issues. One possible extension of this project would be adding a camera for recognizing objects approaching the device or making the information locative.
