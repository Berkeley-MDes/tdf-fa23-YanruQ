# Project1--Computational Design Week3 #
**DESIGN INTENT:** A stable phone stand supports **both vertical and horizontal viewing.**  

**DIFFICULTY LEVEL:** 02-‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è  (My exploration is not only about get acquaintance with gh interfaces but also the design itself. I only use some basic components for this experiment, still need more time to mess around with GH in future projects.) 

**CHALLENGES:**
- Understand components parts in GH
- Practicing designing connections between elements (points, lines, planes, geometries...)
- Reading the GH file and study its logic of making (still in progress)
- Mastering pruse printer setting at Jacobs

**FILES:** [Yanru_PhoneStand_GH](link) / [Yanru_PhoneStand_STL](YANRU_PROJECT1.stl)

## PROCESS ##
**FIRST ITERATION:** Following up the file I created last week, I printed out a test stand which works pretty well. I reduced the infill to 5% but still wasn't satisfied with the interior strcture, and feel like there's a chunk of extra material being used. (approx.4hrs)

**SECOND INTERATION:** I aimed to reduce material usage and increase flexibility for my second iteration. The plan was to create a triangular frame with different-sized platforms that could lock at multiple heights on the frame, adding the feature of adjustable heights. However, after I printed out a miniature version to test the strength of this design, it turned out to be a major failure. The platform couldn't be securely held in place on the triangular frame (I even leave a 2mm gap while printing these seperate parts). Additionally, I didn't consider the weight of the phone, causing the platform to tilt to one side. I struggled to define the cross-section between the platform plane height and the frame, and ended up "lofting" a solid platform. I completed the rest of the design using Fusion360.

Thoughts on this failed iteration: Because I couldn't find a way to make the height as a variable and define the percise cross sections, the size of the platform I made is not accurate. Plus, Even if the platform can secure in place, when it rests on a higher part of this frame, the phone will undoubtly fall because the phone doesn't have enough contact surface with the stand itself.

## RESULT ##
I landed on combining my previous 2 iterations into this final model. I added few more components in GH file to shell the object and fillet the edges. Few final polishing details, I still finished them with the help of Fusion. Thanks to Cody, I finally find the way to build files compatible for both Rhino and Fusion. The overhang angles are set larger than 45 degrees, so it got printed out cleanly without any support, the printing time was also reduced to 2hrs 40mins. There's no big weight difference, but in gernal it's quite easy to carry around. While in use, the support structure hidden behind the screen. This model have pretty much a perfect size, not too small to bear the weight, and it can also be used as a stand for my glasses or may be kychain or something else:) Not expected that to happen. I'm already using it while making video callsüòó

**REFLECTION:** I kept referring to the process of creating a model in another CAD program while building the GH file. I think this design project didn't fully utilize the most exciting features in GH, so I wasn't able to rely on this tool completely. However, in the end, it's just a tool to assist me in finishing my design. From that standpoint, I completed the task. With this basic understanding of GH's use and application, I expect to practice more with it for designing large-scale or complicated structures.
