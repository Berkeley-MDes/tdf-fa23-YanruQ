# Project1--Computational Design Week3 #
**DESIGN INTENT:** A stable phone stand supports both vertical and horizontal viewing.  
**DIFFICULTY LEVEL:** 02-⭐️⭐️  (My exploration is not only about get acquaintance with gh interfaces but also the design itself. I only use some basic components for this experiment, still need more time to mess around with GH in future projects.)  
**CHALLENGES:**
1. Understand components parts in GH
2. Practicing designing connections between elements (points, lines, planes, geometries...)
3. Reading the GH file and study its logic of making (still in progress)
4. Mastering pruse printer settings at Jacobs 

## PROCESS ##
**First Iteration:** Following up the file created last week, I printed out a test stand which works pretty well. I reduced the infill to 5% but still wasn't satisfied with the interior strcture, and feel like there's a chunk of extra material being used. (approx.4hrs)

**Second Iteration:** I was aiming for reducing mataerial and flexibility in using for my second iteration. The plan was to have a triangular frame and different sizes platforms locking at multiple heights on the frame, adding this feature of adjustable heights. However, I wasn't think about the weight of the phone. I printed out a miniture version to test out the structure. The platform can't secure in place on the triangular frame,
