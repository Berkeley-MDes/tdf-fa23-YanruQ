# Project1--Computational Design Week2 #
## Understanding Prameters & Componenets ##
Parameters as input
- Before baking
- Different between 2D & 3D Production

## Start with a Geo ##
Following up a simple tutorial I found online and writting notes on some parameters used in the process of making.

## New Phone Stand Design Trial ##
I tried to mapping out a simple list of instructions on how to build this new design 
- starting with a point in center-->setting up three points with equal distance to the center-->3 sides polygon
- Extrude on Z axis with number siders--> Vertex moves on axis x(tilted angles)
- Shell a triangular cone (which I ended up didn't implement)
- Create a box and tilted to certain angle
- BooleanCombine two objects
- Fillet edge

 Wasn't able to correctly setting plane.
I think using parametric modeling isn't a sufficient choice of making this particular design.

- How to get point information
- Where to get data 
## Problems ##
I failed multiple times while 3D printing even though I used to consider myself as an "expert." Each machine have different setting and user manual that I need to get used to. I started with half actual size of my model, which both failed at the last few layer. I assuemed that it's because the speed of printing and the structure itself have too many hollow parts that would failed to extrend on the existing platform.
