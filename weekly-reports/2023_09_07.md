## Problems ##
I failed multiple times while 3D printing even though I used to consider myself as an "expert." Each machine have different setting and user manual that I need to get used to. I started with half actual size of my model, which both failed at the last few layer. I assuemed that it's because the speed of printing and the structure itself have too many hollow part that would failed to extrend on the existing platform.
