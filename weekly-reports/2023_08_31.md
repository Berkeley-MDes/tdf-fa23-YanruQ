# Project1--Computational Design Week1
## GrassHopper Interface Exploration ##
My 3D modeling experience was mainly in Fusion360. The logic of making model that's being designed with exact dimension and parametric design process has different approaches to the end-product. As a new user, it's NEITHER easy to navigate through the massive network in GH NOR practice this . It would be helpful if the design process is being explained a little more during class sessions. 
**Iteration Intention**: Instead of having the phone stand horizontally, I usually film video vertically. 

Step1:

Step2: The angle of the phone need to be slightly

## Problems ##
I was having trouble exporting the design because I wasn't quite understand the "BAKE" feature.

Even though I 've set up the file before I went to cut, I made some chances based on the scrape material I found in shop. 
**Fail**:the setting for laser wasn't able to cut through the board for the first time, it went thorugh for the second time. Need more experiement when working with different material and thickness. However, the parts can't fit together, I assumed that the cutout need to be slightly larger than the thickness of wood so it's can go through.
