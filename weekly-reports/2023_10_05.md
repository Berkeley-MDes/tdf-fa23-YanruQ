# PHYSICAL COMPUTING - WEEK 3 #

### CAPABILITY OF SENSORS ### 
- Categorize colors  
  I noticed there are many documentation and experimentation happening during the design process but I am still lost about how I as a beginner gathering information about each microcontroller (as well as the coding) and put them together to implement my desire effect.
  I was particular interested in tail structure: the moving machenism and the skeleton beneath it but I have no idea how should I start my exploration

- Inputting gestures

### GROUPING ### 
In Thur. class, we tried out some basic circuits:  
- light up the embedded led (which connects to pin7);  
- Adding the photosythesis as a switch for the led light.
