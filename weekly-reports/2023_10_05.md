### CAPABILITY OF SENSORS ### 
During Monday's lectures, we've seen two different application for sensors. They're all about information transformation.
- **Categorize colors**  
I noticed that there is a lot of documentation and experimentation happening during the design process, but as a beginner, I am still unsure about how to gather information about each microcontroller, including the coding, and how to put them together to implement my desired effect.
I was particular interested in tail structure: the moving machenism and the skeleton beneath it but I have no idea how should I start my exploration. Below are some reference images related to my interest.

- **Inputting gestures**  
It's cool to see how these different softwares can anlayze the sound pattern or turing gestures into a cluster of data for processing but I would prefer more hand-on exercise and experience more than just seeing the magic happend on screen. It's frustrated when I lost track of how it works. For some of the interfaces, the words, even got projected to the screen, are too small to be seen from distance even I was sitting on the second row.

### GROUPING ### 
I was in the wire sculptor team. There're many difficulties in terms of team work on exploratory-based projects like this. Everyone in the team have a different level experiencing with physical computing and expected distinct learning outcomes. Some prefer putting more effort into the mechanical parts of this interaction while some want to focus on the communicaton between the information input source and sensors.   


We set up a one-hour group meeting after class to discuss everyone's concepts, but we still couldn't make any decisions because we all insisted on our own ideas. I felt that after sharing my ideas, no one was interested, and everyone spent time talking about their own vision on how to implement their projects, leaving me with no chance to comment. Lastly, we decided to form two groups based on abstract concepts: one group would focus on the **construction process** (creating something new), while the other would concentrate on the **deconstruction** of something.  

**From Deconstruction to A Defensive system**  
We've come a long way to finally agree on one idea to work on. Considering the time constraints, we simply want to focus on the interaction and motor movement for the first week, aiming to build a sketchy working prototype. In the second week, we could elaborate on the final presentation, adding design aspects to the artifacts.
