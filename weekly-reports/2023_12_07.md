### Message Mapping
```Ruby
import random
from openai import OpenAI
from gtts import gTTS
import os

client = OpenAI(api_key="________")

messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are generating irrelevant answer to the questions."}] 
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "Response in a casul and friendly tone includes light-hearted teasing."}] 
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "Limit the response in 15s."}] 
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "If the question prompts change too frequent, ask them to be patient."}] 

message_map = {
    1: "Please response to request quickly",
    2: "Can you detect what's my mood today?",
    3: "Imagine an alien's first encounter with a rubber duck",
    4: "say random thing that makes me laugh",
    5: "Give me some dinner recommandations",
    6: "What would happen if squirrels suddenly gained super intelligence?",
    7: "Write a conversation between a cat and a dog about who is the better pet",
    8: "Help me make a plan for Chirstmas",
    9: "Explain how to teach a robot to do a funny dance.",
    10: "Create a dialogue between two dogs discussing their plans to take over the world.",
}

while True: 
    user_input = random.randint(1, 10)  # Randomly pick a number between 1 and 10
    message = message_map.get(user_input, "Default context setting for bot") 

    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": message})
    chat = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages) 

    reply = chat.choices[0].message.content 

        # Use gTTS to speak the response
    tts = gTTS(text=reply, lang='en')
    tts.save("response.mp3")
    os.system("afplay response.mp3")
        
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": reply})
```
### Button Connection
Thec code turns out to be currect but the red light flashed on photon is not a right signal. Hence, I've fighting with this serial connection for a bit but after I change it to a regular button and double check the connection, it works. 
```Ruby
int buttonPin = D2; // Button's pin
int buttonState = 0;
int lastButtonState = 0; // To store the previous state of the button

void setup() {
    pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP); // Set the button as an input
    Serial.begin(9600); // Start serial communication
}

void loop() {
    buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

    // Check if button state changed from not pressed to pressed
    if (buttonState == HIGH && lastButtonState == LOW) {
        int randomNumber = rand() % 10; // Generate a random number between 0-9
        Serial.println(randomNumber); // Send the number over serial
    }

    lastButtonState = buttonState; // Update the last button state
    delay(50); // Debounce delay
}
```
